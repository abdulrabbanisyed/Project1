# Predicting Global Weather Control with Ocean Currents Global Ocean currents

Global Ocean currents greatly decide the weather patterns of the world and are also a significant metric to measure the global warming level.
Many Marine scientists procure data from the ocean and study the pattern of global temperature. But that data can be used for analysis and if an ML algorithm can be applied
to predict the global temperature of our earth is the main agenda.


-Found a website that holds the ocean currents data, currently working on retrieving the data and preprocessing it for feature extraction.

1. The website holds ocean temperature data per hour based on region and seismic activity as well in the form of PNG images.
2. There is another format of files that holds certain information about water temperature which can be one of the significant features to work on.
