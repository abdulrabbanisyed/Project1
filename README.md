Predicting Global Weather Control with Ocean Currents
Global Ocean currents greatly decide the weather patterns of the world and are also a significant metric to measure the global warming level.
Many Marine scientists procure data from the ocean and study the pattern of global temperature. But that data can be used for analysis and if an ML algorithm can be applied
to predict the global temperature of our earth is the main agenda.
